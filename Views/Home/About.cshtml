                The NSDC website developers are Aitemir Yeskenov and Zicheng Xiao. Both are current graduate students at the University of South Florida pursuing degree in
                Business Analytics and Information Systems. For this project the team decided to create a set of HTML&CSS-based webpages at first to present mock version of
                the web application to the professor. The developers then implemented their idea from the static version into reality by building the project in ASP.net core environment.
                Yeskenov and Xiao used .NET MVC framework, built SQL Server Database, and connected the back-end piece with the views. Part of the development is consumption of external
                api from api.data.gov/ed/collegescorecard/.
                For the professional user experience and feel the team used CDN links to achieve traditional Google Material design UI look that is available from getmdl.io/.

            Aitemir contributed to this project by applying his web-development
            knowledge. At his previous job he used Angular framework to create
            front-end applications and Java on Spring MVC. Despite the fact that
            Angular's HTML code looks way different in the final product, in this
            version for the assignment 4, he implemented the look and feel by using
            the CDN to the Google's CSS so as to mimic the interface and make it
            look in the Google Material style. He designed and developed the database
            using the in-built tools in Visual Studio. His main contribution was to
            build the database and connect the back-end part with the views.

            Zicheng contributed his professional knowledge to the NSDC project.
            One of his main responsibilities was to design the visual layout of
            the future application. Zicheng was also in charge of researching the
            data resources and filtering the data from the API’s url found on the Internet.
            He also worked on the database creation and population of data objects on the view part.
